    Nutrition focuses on how people can use dietary choices to reduce the risk of disease, what happens if a person has too much or too little of a nutrient, and how allergies work.
    Nutrients provide nourishment. Proteins, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water are all nutrients. If people do not have the right balance of nutrients in their diet, their risk of developing certain health conditions increases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h1>Macronutrients</h1>
        Macronutrients are nutrients that people need in relatively large quantities.<br><br>
<h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
Sugar, starch, and fiber are types of carbohydrates.
Sugars are simple carbs. The body quickly breaks down and absorbs sugars and processed starch. They can provide rapid energy, but they do not leave a person feeling full. They can also cause a spike in blood sugar levels. Frequent sugar spikes increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications.
Fiber is also a carbohydrate. The body breaks down some types of fiber and uses them for energy others are metabolized by gut bacteria, while other types pass through the body.
Fiber and unprocessed starch are complex carbs. It takes the body some time to break down and absorb complex carbs. After eating fiber, a person will feel full for longer. Fiber may also reduce the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer. Complex carbs are a more healthful choice than sugars and refined carbs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br><h2>Proteins</h2>
Proteins consist of amino acids, which are organic compounds that occur naturally.

There are 20 amino acids. Some of these are essential, which means people need to obtain them from food. The body can make the others.

Some foods provide complete protein, which means they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs. Other foods contain various combinations of amino acids.

Most plant-based foods do not contain complete protein, so a person who follows a vegan diet needs to eat a range of foods throughout the day that provides the essential amino acids.
    </p>
    <p><br>
        <h2>Fats</h2>
        Fats are essential for:
<ul>
        
    <li>Lubricating joints</li>
    <li>Helping organs produce hormones</li>
    <li>Enabling the body to absorb certain vitamins</li>
    <li>Reducing inflammation</li>
    <li>Preserving brain health</li>
    Too much fat can lead to obesity, high cholesterol, liver disease, and other health problems.

</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Water</h2>
The adult human body is up to 60% water, and it needs water for many processes. Water contains no calories, and it does not provide energy.

Many people recommend consuming 2 liters, or 8 glasses, of water a day, but it can also come from dietary sources, such as fruits and vegetables. Adequate hydration will result in pale yellow urine.

Requirements will also depend on an individualâ€™s body size and age, environmental factors, activity levels, health status, and so on.
